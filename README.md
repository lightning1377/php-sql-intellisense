# php-sql-intellisense README

Welcome to the README for your "php-sql-intellisense" extension! This extension provides SQL IntelliSense support for writing MySQL queries in PHP using the PDO library.

## Features

Currently, the extension offers the following features:

-   SQL IntelliSense support for MySQL queries (A custom parser is used for this as I couldn't get any of the parsers out there to correctly parse an unfinished query)
-   Parsing and validation of SQL queries in PHP documents (To report any invalid field/table names used in queries)
-   Type provider for db fields

## Requirements

This extension requires Visual Studio Code.

## Extension Settings

This extension does not contribute any custom settings.

## Known Issues

-   Given db username and password are removed on connection error, although the error might not be with authentication

## Usage Guide

1. Open Extension settings and provide address of database server and the name of database in either User or Workspace settings.

-   Enter the address without the port, port is considered 3306 as default.

2. Open command palette and select the action Connect to database.

-   All of this extensionâ€™s commands can be found by searching SQL-PHP in the command palette.

3. Enter the username and password for your remote connection to database.

You should see a message window indicating that the connection was successful in the bottom-side corner after a few moments.
Username and password are stored in secrets and can only be cleared by the Delete database credentials command.
